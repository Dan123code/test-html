<h1 style="font-family: 'arial';">What Was The Titanic?</h1><p style="font-family: 'arial';">The <strong><em>Titanic</em></strong> was the biggest ship in <time>1912</time>, but the Titanic struck an iceberg then sank.</p><img src="https://www.irishcentral.com/uploads/article/132079/cropped_GettyImages-3096463.jpg?t=1554291836" width="600" height="400"><h1 style="font-family: 'arial';">What Was The Titanic To Begin With?</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'arial';">So what was the Titanic to begin with? To find that out we have to date back to <time>1910.</time>
<br>On <time>1910</time>, two people named Harland and Wolff were the builders of the <abbr>RMS Titanic</abbr>.
<br>The number of shipbuilders to build the Titanic was 3,000. But unfortunately,
<br>
eight shipbuilders died during the ship's construction.</p>
<h1 style="font-family: 'arial';">The Two Sister Ships</h1><p style="font-family: 'arial';">During when the the Titanic was being built, Thre were also two ships next to it,
<br>
"Olympic," and "Gigantic." Gigantic will be later renamed to,
<br>
"Britannic." Here is an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Britannic">article</a> about it.</p><img src="https://i.redd.it/sd95w0kom2p41.png" width="200" height="330">
<h1 style="font-family: 'arial';">The Classes</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'arial';">After the <abbr>RMS</abbr> Titanic was built, it was ready to lauch in <time>1911</time>. As soon as everybody heard
<br>
about it, everbody wanted to book for a class. There were three classes, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
<br>
1st class was much more expensive than the other classes, but the 1st class berth<br>was much better.</p><p style="font-family: 'arial';">These show how much money was for each class berth:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family: 'arial';">$150 for first class ($1,700 today)</li>
<li style="font-family: 'arial';">$60 for second class ($1,834 today)</li>
<li style="font-family: 'arial';">$35 for thrid class ($1,071 today)</li>
</ul><h1 style="font-family: 'arial';">Where It All Ties Together</h1><p style="font-family: 'arial';">On <time>April 15, 1912,</time> everybody was hed to sleep, some were having dinner.<br>as the Titanic moved forward it felt colder. As they knew itn one of<br>
the people saw a wierd figure towards them. It was an iceberg! When they saw<br>it, they pulled the emergency bell frm the crow's nest. every worker had to do<br>
something immediately, they had to turn the ship to avoid the iceberg<br>
but, it was too late, the iceberg scraped one of the sides of the<br>Titanic.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'arial';">It was time to set up the lifeboats, but the rule for the<br>lifeboats were, "Women and children first." At <time>2:20 AM</time> The Titanic sank.<br>About 1,500 died.</p><img src="https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/Titanic-sinking-enlarge.jpg" width="300" height="200">
